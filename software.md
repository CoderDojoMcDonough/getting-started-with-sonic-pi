# Software

Sonic Pi v2.0 has been included in Raspbian since September 2014 so if you're using a recent image you should have this version installed.

To check you have version 2, double click the `Sonic Pi` icon on the desktop or find it in the application menu under Education. The splash screen shown while loading shows the version number.

If you don't have Sonic Pi at all, type the following command in to LXTerminal which you can access by clicking on **Main Menu**, **Accessories** and **Terminal**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sonic-pi
```

To upgrade from version 1, type:

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade sonic-pi
```

Note: You will need to be connected to the internet to install or upgrade.
